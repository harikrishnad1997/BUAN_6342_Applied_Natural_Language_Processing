This translation is essential because machine learning models, especially neural networks, can't process raw text. Instead, they require numerical input for various tasks like classification, sentiment analysis, or language translation.\n","\n","**The Concept of Word Embeddings**\n","\n","Word embeddings are a specific type of embedding that converts individual words into vectors of real numbers.\n","\n","- **Why Use Embeddings?**\n","  - Machine learning models can't understand text, so embeddings convert words into a format these models can work with.\n","  - They capture semantic relationships between words, meaning that words with similar meanings will have similar representations.\n","\n","\n","**Simple Word Embeddin Example**\n","\n","The accompanying table and graph provide a tangible illustration of word embeddings. In the table, words like \"apple,\" \"banana,\" \"car,\" and others are represented by vectors in a 2-dimensional space - Dimension 1 and Dimension 2. This simplification helps visualize how embeddings work.\n","\n","In the graph, each word is plotted according to its vector values. Words with similar meanings or contexts tend to be closer together. For instance, \"bus\" and \"truck,\" both modes of transportation, are plotted near each other. This proximity signifies their semantic similarity in the embedding space.\n","\n","<table>\n","<tr>\n","<td>\n","<td><img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HKk6DfRx0Q8lhyzVblH9OCh_bVxUsl1y' width='500'/></td>\n","</td>\n","<td><img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Tk0jfFVKV2moEljHVzCZofjSRr9hr7Wx' width='500'/></td>\n","</tr>\n","</table>\n","\n"," *In real-world NLP tasks, embeddings usually have a much higher dimension (often in the hundreds) to capture the complex and nuanced relationships between words*. High-dimensional embeddings can represent an extensive range of semantic and syntactic word properties.\n","\n","**Learning and Using Embeddings**\n","- **Embedding Layers in Neural Networks**: In deep learning models, embedding layers are used to learn word representations. These layers can be initialized randomly and then learned from data during training.\n","- **Pre-trained Embeddings**: Often, pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT embeddings are used, which have been trained on large text corpora and can capture rich language semantics.\n","\n","**Conclusion**\n","\n","Embeddings are a foundational technique in NLP, enabling machines to process and understand textual data. Through the course, we will explore different ways to learn and use embeddings, starting with understanding basic embedding layers in Pytorch `nn.Embedding` and `nn.EmbeddingBag`."],"metadata":{"id":"9OwxU3lHGCcl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hxg5WO71MFbh"},"source":["# <Font color = 'indianred'>**PyTorch Embedding Layers**\n","\n","`nn.Embedding` and `nn.EmbeddingBag` are two modules provided by PyTorch, a popular library for machine learning and neural network research. These modules are used for dealing with embeddings in neural networks. Here's a brief description of each:\n","\n","1. <Font color = 'indianred'> **nn.Embedding**\n","  - `nn.Embedding` in PyTorch is a simple lookup table that stores embeddings of a fixed dictionary and size. It serves as a layer in neural networks specifically for handling embeddings.\n","  - This module maps indices of words in a vocabulary to their corresponding embedding vectors.\n","  - Upon initialization, `nn.Embedding` creates a weight matrix of size `V x D`, where `V` is the size of the vocabulary (number of unique words) and `D` is the dimensionality of the embeddings. These weights are learnable parameters that the neural network will adjust during training.\n","  - The primary arguments for `nn.Embedding` are the size of the dictionary (V) and the size of each embedding vector (D). For instance, `nn.Embedding(10000, 300)` creates an embedding layer for a vocabulary of 10,000 words, each represented by a 300-dimensional vector.\n","  - When the embedding layer receives an input index (or indices), it outputs the corresponding embedding vector (or vectors) from this matrix. Essentially, the layer transforms the input indices into dense vectors that capture the semantic properties of the words.\n","  - `nn.Embedding` is commonly used in various natural language processing tasks, enabling models to process words (tokens) as meaningful vectors and learn rich representations of language in their hidden layers.\n","\n","\n","   <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HLcqG5ZI7lQEFv3X2f2VzA7JSpO2PYfq' width='800'/>\n","\n","\n","\n","2. <Font color = 'indianred'>**nn.EmbeddingBag**\n","   - `nn.EmbeddingBag` is similar to `nn.Embedding` but with an additional feature: it computes the mean or sum of 'bags' of embeddings, without instantiating the intermediate embeddings.\n","   - This module is particularly useful for efficiently computing the embeddings for a dataset with varying-length sequences of indices, such as sentences in a paragraph.\n","   - It's optimized for certain use cases where you want to aggregate the embeddings of multiple items (like words in a sentence). For instance, it's beneficial in applications like text classification, where you might want to take the average of all word embeddings in a sentence as its representation.\n","   - `nn.EmbeddingBag` also takes the size of the dictionary and the size of each embedding vector as its primary arguments.\n","\n","In summary, while both `nn.Embedding` and `nn.EmbeddingBag` are used for handling embeddings in PyTorch, `nn.Embedding` is more straightforward and suitable for individual word embeddings, whereas `nn.EmbeddingBag` is optimized for aggregating embeddings over a sequence of data, making it more efficient for certain tasks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# <Font color = 'indianred'>**Understanding Embedding Layers with a simple example**"],"metadata":{"id":"eLpKLH75UzuC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# <Font color = 'indianred'>**Understanding Embedding Layers with a simple example**"],"metadata":{"id":"GM9usJ9lDWnh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Objective**: Understanding the inputs and outputs of nn.Embedding and nn.EmbeddingBag Layers\n","\n","The embedding layers  in neural networks is essential for converting words in a vocabulary into dense vectors.
